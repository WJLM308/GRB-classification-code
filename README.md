# GRB classification code
 Python scripts used for scraping, classifying, and plotting GRBs as seen in https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/acb999
 
 Apologies for the lack of organization, especially in Misc.ipynb -- this was my "test" file for this project, but it contains a few relevant cells for creating various figures. If I have time I will try to improve overall readability.

 Some of the code for generating certain files has been lost, so I've additionally uploaded the required files.
 
 Feel free to reach out with any questions :)
