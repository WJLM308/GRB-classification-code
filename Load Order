Some lines for saving files are commented out in order to prevent accidental rewrites, so this won't work unless you uncomment them.

Also, some of the code for generating certain files has been carelessly deleted, so I'll upload all the required files separately.

Generally speaking, the load order is:

  Getting_required_files
  Generating_dataset
  config/embedding (due to a poor design choice they are dependent on each other, so just run config first with some lines commented out, or copy and paste config into embedding)
  plotting (you can hand-classify the dataset using the built-in widget)
  Fermi-Swift Intersection Download
  plotting_Intersection
  random_sample_test (optional -- takes a long time)
  Misc (only a few cells are relevant)
