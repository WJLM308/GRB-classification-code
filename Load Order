Some lines for saving files are commented out in order to prevent accidental rewrites, so this won't work unless you uncomment them.

Generally speaking, the load order is:

  Getting_required_files
  Generating_dataset
  config/embedding (due to a poor design choice they are dependent on each other, so just run config first with some lines commented out, or copy and paste config into embedding)
  plotting (you can hand-classify the dataset using the built-in widget)
  Fermi-Swift Intersection Download
  plotting_Intersection
  random_sample_test (optional -- takes a long time)
  Misc (only a few cells are relevant)
